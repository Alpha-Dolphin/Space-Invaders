THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 4
BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE
MYSELF WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE
INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.


My name is Ben Elleman, and this lab took me about 10 in total, including all the bonus point stuff. It seems like
this lab was originally meant to have a lot more stuff, like we never did anything with the bombs and this felt like
much less work overall than the previous labs, and I'm pretty sure we had the most amount of time on this lab to get
all the stuff that was here done. I'm sad the space invaders saga is going to end here, I really liked having a
continuous project that we incrimentally made better and better. I still hate that the prototypes have to work
which means I have to go and retrofit all of them after my lab is done and I've changed things to where the
original prototype no longer works.
